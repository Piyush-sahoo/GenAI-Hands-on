      " AI Transforming Healthcare  NEW YORK — Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the healthcare industry, revolutionizing diagnostics, treatment planning, and patient care. Hospitals and research institutions worldwide are increasingly deploying AI algorithms to detect diseases earlier and  more accurately than traditional methods. For instance, AI models trained on medical imaging data can now identify cancers such as breast and lung cancer with precision rivaling that of expert radiologists.  In addition to diagnostics, AI-powered tools are being used to personalize treatment plans for patients. Algorithms can analyze vast amounts of patient data — from genetic information to medical history — and suggest optimal treatment strategies tailored to each individual.  Pharmaceutical companies are also leveraging AI to accelerate drug discovery, reducing the time and cost required to bring new medicines to market.  Despite its promise, AI in healthcare faces several challenges. Ethical concerns regarding patient privacy, data security, and algorithmic bias  remain high on the agenda. Experts emphasize the importance of transparency and explainability in AI systems, especially when these tools influence  life-and-death decisions. Governments and regulatory bodies are now working to implement standards that ensure AI-driven healthcare solutions are safe,  effective, and equitable.  Looking forward, AI is expected to play an increasingly central role in global health initiatives. Telemedicine platforms integrated with AI triage systems are making healthcare more accessible in rural and underserved areas. Additionally, predictive models can forecast outbreaks of infectious  diseases, allowing policymakers to respond proactively. While there is still a long road ahead, the integration of AI into healthcare has the potential to improve outcomes, reduce costs, and democratize access to quality medical care worldwide.\n"

    "\n",
    "This project focuses on building a TL;DR summarization system for news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It allows users to input either a long news article URL or directly paste article text. When a URL is provided, the system automatically fetches and extracts the readable content from the webpage using web scraping techniques. The extracted or pasted text is then passed to a Hugging Face summarization pipeline powered by the DistilBART model, which is optimized for fast and efficient text summarization.\n",
    "The project demonstrates practical applications of transformer-based models in real-world scenarios such as news consumption and information overload. By generating concise summaries from lengthy articles, the system helps users quickly understand the key ideas without reading the entire content. It also highlights important considerations such as handling web content limitations, preprocessing text, and producing readable outputs suitable for terminal or notebook environments.\n"
