Daily Horoscope Generator – Project Overview

Goal
The project aims to automatically generate vague but convincing daily horoscopes for any zodiac sign. By leveraging a language model (GPT-2 or DistilGPT-2), the system produces mystical, uplifting, and personalized fortunes that mimic the style of traditional astrology readings.

Technology Stack:
1.Python – Core programming language

2.Hugging Face Transformers – Provides access to pretrained models like GPT-2 and DistilGPT-2

3.GPT-2 – Text generation models used to produce horoscope content

4.Google Colab – Execution environment for easy setup and experimentation
  
How It Works:
1.Input: User provides a zodiac sign (e.g., Taurus).
2.Prompt Engineering: A carefully crafted text prompt guides the model to generate horoscope-style content.
3.Text Generation: GPT-2 generates a continuation of the prompt, producing a horoscope.
4.Output: A short, poetic horoscope that includes themes of emotions, opportunities, and subtle warnings.
