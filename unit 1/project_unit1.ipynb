    "OVERVIEW:\n",
    "Sen's Fortress is a treacherous area in Dark Souls located between Anor Londo and Undead Parish. It serves as a proving ground for those seeking to enter Anor Londo. The fortress is filled with deadly traps, including swinging blade pendulums, arrow traps, and narrow walkways over bottomless pits.\n",
    "\n",
    "ENTRANCE:\n",
    "The entrance to Sen's Fortress is located past the blacksmith Andre in Undead Parish. After ringing both Bells of Awakening, the massive gate will open, allowing access. The first thing you'll notice is a narrow bridge leading into the fortress.\n",
    "\n",
    "GROUND FLOOR - BLADE CORRIDORS:\n",
    "The ground floor features the infamous swinging blade pendulums. These massive blades swing back and forth across narrow corridors. Timing is crucial - watch the pattern and run through when safe. Snake soldiers patrol these areas, wielding lightning-enchanted weapons. The first checkpoint bonfire is at the top in Sen's Fortress itself - you must make it all the way through or return to Undead Parish.\n",
    "\n",
    "HIDDEN KEY LOCATION:\n",
    "The Cage Key is hidden on the ground floor of Sen's Fortress. To find it, navigate past the first set of swinging blades and look for a narrow passage on the left side. This passage leads to a room with a Shotel merchant. The Cage Key is located on a corpse in a small alcove near the merchant. This key is essential as it unlocks the cages at the top of the fortress, including one containing Logan the Sorcerer.\n",
    "\n",
    "ARROW TRAPS:\n",
    "Throughout the fortress, pressure plates trigger arrow traps. These are particularly dangerous on the narrow walkways. Look for slight discolorations on the floor to spot pressure plates. Rolling or running quickly across them can help you avoid damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "UPPER LEVELS - THE ROOFTOP:\n",
    "After surviving the blade corridors, you'll reach a tower with stairs leading upward. The rooftop area features narrow walkways with no railings - a single misstep means falling to your death. Boulder traps roll down ramps here, and a Giant at the top throws explosive boulders down at you.\n",
    "\n",
    "THE GIANT AND BOULDERS:\n",
    "At the top of the fortress, a Giant continuously throws boulders down the ramps. You can either fight the Giant or use the boulders to your advantage - they can break through certain walls, revealing secret areas. One boulder-breakable wall leads to a room containing the Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring.\n",
    "\n",
    "BOSS - IRON GOLEM:\n",
    "The Iron Golem awaits at the very top of Sen's Fortress, guarding the entrance to Anor Londo. This massive construct fights on a platform with no walls - it's easy to be knocked off. The boss has powerful sweeping attacks but is vulnerable to being staggered. Attacking its legs can cause it to fall, leaving it open for critical hits. Lightning damage is particularly effective against the Iron Golem.\n",
    "\n",
    "ITEMS AND TREASURES:\n",
    "- Cage Key: Found near the Shotel merchant on the ground floor, unlocks cages\n",
    "- Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring: Behind a boulder-breakable wall on the upper levels\n",
    "- Lightning Spear: Located on a narrow walkway near the rooftop area\n",
    "- Rare Ring of Sacrifice: On a corpse in one of the side rooms\n",
    "- Covetous Gold Serpent Ring: Found after defeating the Iron Golem, in Anor Londo\n",
    "\n",
    "NPCS:\n",
    "- Big Hat Logan: Trapped in a cage inside the fortress, requires the Cage Key to free him\n",
    "- Siegmeyer of Catarina: Can be found on the near an upward staircase with boulders rolling down if you've been following his questline\n",
    "\n",
    "SHORTCUTS:\n",
    "After reaching the rooftop, you can find a cage lift that returns you to near the entrance. This provides a shortcut for future runs through the fortress. Additionally, there's a hidden path near the boulder ramps that leads to a room with treasure and another path back down.\n",
    "\n",
    "ENEMIES:\n",
    "- Snake Soldiers: Fast, aggressive enemies with lightning weapons and high poise\n",
    "- Snake Mages: Cast ranged lightning spells, very dangerous on narrow platforms\n",
    "- Giant: Throws boulders from the top of the fortress\n",
    "- Titanite Demons: Optional mini-bosses found in side areas\n",
    "\n",
    "TIPS FOR SUCCESS:\n",
    "1. Take your time with the swinging blades - rushing leads to death\n",
    "2. Use a shield with high lightning resistance against snake soldiers\n",
    "3. The Cage Key is essential for freeing Logan and accessing certain areas\n",
    "4. Bring plenty of healing items - there's no bonfire until the top of the fortress\n",
    "5. Consider using the Ring of Fog to avoid some enemy encounters\n",
    "6. The boulder can be used to damage enemies - bait them into its path\n",
    "\n",
    "AFTER SEN'S FORTRESS:\n",
    "Defeating the Iron Golem triggers a cutscene where bat-like demons carry you to Anor Londo, the golden city of the gods. This marks a major progression point in the game.\n",
