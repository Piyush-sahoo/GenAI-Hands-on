        "\n",
        "The `pipeline()` function is a high-level API provided by the Hugging Face `transformers` library. It simplifies the process of using pre-trained models for various NLP tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Purpose:** It abstracts away the complex steps of data preprocessing, model inference, and post-processing into a single, easy-to-use interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Features:**\n",
        "-   **Task-specific:** You initialize it by specifying a task (e.g., 'text-generation', 'summarization', 'question-answering', 'ner', 'fill-mask').\n",
        "-   **Model Loading:** Automatically downloads and loads a suitable pre-trained model for the specified task (or a specific model if provided).\n",
        "-   **End-to-End Processing:** Handles tokenization, model prediction, and converting raw model outputs into human-readable results.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Usage Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from transformers import pipeline\n",
        "\n",
        "generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')\n",

        "The `set_seed()` function, when imported from `transformers`, is used to ensure the reproducibility of results in operations that involve randomness.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Purpose:** Machine learning models, especially deep learning models, often involve random initialization of weights or random sampling during generation. Setting a seed ensures that these random processes produce the same sequence of 'random' numbers each time the code is run.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Benefit:** This is crucial for debugging, comparing different model configurations, and verifying results, as it eliminates variability due to randomness.\n",
